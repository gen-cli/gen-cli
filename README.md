# Gen CLI

forked from [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## Quickstart

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key (copy from [here](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/account/ak)).

   ```bash
   export SILICONFLOW_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
3. **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx https://github.com/gen-cli/gen-cli
   ```

   Or install it with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @gen-cli/gen-cli
   gen
   ```

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with Gemini from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Gemini Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gen-cli/gen-cli
cd gen-cli
gen
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
